## 📂 Projects  

### 🥭 Gesture Detection using YOLOv8
[🔗 View Repository](https://github.com/AbdulMoizZuberi/Gesture-Detection-Using_Yolov8)  
- Real-time Recognition: The project aims to use YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection model, to recognize and classify hand gestures in real-time from video feeds or images.
- Custom Dataset: It likely involves training the YOLOv8 model on a custom dataset of hand gestures, which is a common practice for such projects to achieve high accuracy.  
- Practical Application: The trained model can be used for various applications, such as assistive systems for the hearing impaired, human-computer interaction, or controlling smart devices with hand movements.

### 📊 Cricket World Cup EDA Project 
[🔗 View Repository]([https://github.com/yourusername/Churn-Prediction](https://github.com/AbdulMoizZuberi/EDA-on-Cricket-World-Cup) 
- Data Preparation: The notebook loaded multiple CSV files for various Cricket World Cups, renamed columns to standardize them, and merged them into a single pandas DataFrame. It also converted the 'Date' column to a datetime format.
- Initial Analysis: It performed a basic exploratory data analysis to find the total number of matches played across all the World Cups.  
- Win Percentage Calculation: The notebook calculated the number of wins for each team by extracting team names and the winner from the 'Match' and 'Result' columns, respectively.

### 🖼️ Netflix Movie Dataset EDA Project 
[🔗 View Repository]([https://github.com/yourusername/Image-Classifier](https://github.com/AbdulMoizZuberi/EDA-on-Netflix-Movies-Dataset)
- Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, removed duplicates, renamed columns, and converted data types for consistency.  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed patterns in genres, countries, release years, and content ratings to identify key insights.  
- Data Visualization: Used bar charts, count plots, and heatmaps to effectively present content trends and patterns in the Netflix dataset.
